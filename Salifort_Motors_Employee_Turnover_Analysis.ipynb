    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "Salifort Motors is facing a high employee turnover rate, which impacts productivity and increases recruitment/training costs. Our goal was to identify factors contributing to turnover and develop a predictive model to support HR in improving employee retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods\n",
    "Using a dataset of 14,999 employees, we:\n",
    "- Performed exploratory data analysis to identify trends\n",
    "- Built four predictive models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost\n",
    "- Evaluated model accuracy, recall, and feature importance\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Findings\n",
    "- **Satisfaction level** and **average monthly hours** are the most influential factors in employee departure.\n",
    "- Employees with low satisfaction and **no promotions in the last 5 years** are more likely to leave.\n",
    "- **Low salary** groups have a higher turnover rate.\n",
    "- Random Forest and XGBoost performed the best, with over 90% accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "| Model             | Accuracy | Precision | Recall |\n",
    "|------------------|----------|-----------|--------|\n",
    "| Logistic Regression | ~77%    | Moderate  | Moderate |\n",
    "| Decision Tree       | ~89%    | Good      | Good    |\n",
    "| Random Forest       | ~91%    | High      | High    |\n",
    "| XGBoost             | ~92%    | High      | High    |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommendations\n",
    "- Develop strategies to improve **employee satisfaction** and **recognition programs**.\n",
    "- Encourage **career growth** through promotion paths and mentorship.\n",
    "- Reduce overwork by **monitoring average monthly hours** and adjusting workloads.\n",
    "- Consider **compensation reviews**, especially for those in lower salary tiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "- Deploy the XGBoost model in HR systems for real-time turnover risk scoring.\n",
    "- Collaborate with department managers to implement data-driven retention initiatives.\n",
    "- Reassess and monitor model performance quarterly to ensure long-term accuracy.\n"
