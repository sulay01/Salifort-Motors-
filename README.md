| satisfaction_level     | Self-reported satisfaction score [0-1]                       |
| last_evaluation        | Last performance review score [0-1]                          |
| number_project         | Number of projects the employee worked on                    |
| average_monthly_hours  | Avg monthly work hours                                       |

## 🔍 Key Findings

- Employees with low satisfaction and no promotions are more likely to leave.
- High average monthly hours correlate with higher turnover risk.
- Low salary is a strong indicator of potential departure.
- Feature importance from Random Forest and XGBoost validated these insights.

## 🧪 Models & Performance

| Model             | Accuracy | Notes                         |
|------------------|----------|-------------------------------|
| Logistic Regression | ~77%  | Baseline performance          |
| Decision Tree       | ~89%  | Strong, easy to interpret     |
| Random Forest       | ~91%  | Great balance of precision/recall |
| XGBoost             | ~92%  | Best performer overall        |
