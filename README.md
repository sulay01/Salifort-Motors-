## üîç Key Findings

- Employees with low satisfaction and no promotions are more likely to leave.
- High average monthly hours correlate with higher turnover risk.
- Low salary is a strong indicator of potential departure.
- Feature importance from Random Forest and XGBoost validated these insights.

## üß™ Models & Performance

| Model             | Accuracy | Notes                         |
|------------------|----------|-------------------------------|
| Logistic Regression | ~77%  | Baseline performance          |
| Decision Tree       | ~89%  | Strong, easy to interpret     |
| Random Forest       | ~91%  | Great balance of precision/recall |
| XGBoost             | ~92%  | Best performer overall        |

## ‚úÖ Recommendations

- Improve satisfaction through employee engagement programs.
- Offer clearer promotion paths and career development.
- Monitor workload and reduce overwork in high-burnout departments.
- Consider salary benchmarking and reviews.
- Deploy predictive models in HR systems to flag high-risk employees.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion
The Salifort Motors Employee Turnover Project demonstrates how data analytics and machine learning can be leveraged to tackle real-world HR challenges. Through comprehensive exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, and data visualization, this project uncovered key drivers of attrition‚Äîsuch as low satisfaction, lack of promotion, excessive workload, and low compensation.

The predictive models, especially Random Forest and XGBoost, achieved high accuracy in forecasting employee turnover, offering HR departments actionable tools for early intervention. These insights empower leadership to take a proactive stance on employee retention, fostering a more engaged and stable workforce.

This project reflects the application of the full PACE (Plan, Analyze, Construct, Execute) framework, aligning business questions with data-driven decision-making. With strategic recommendations backed by visual storytelling in Power BI and Tableau, this capstone not only enhances operational awareness but also serves as a strong portfolio piece demonstrating end-to-end analytical proficiency.
